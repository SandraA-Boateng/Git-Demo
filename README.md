# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis  

## Project Description  

This repository includes the Class 1 survey dataset and R Markdown code used to analyze it.  

The project is part of an exercise to practice working with real-world survey data in R.  

## Files Included  

- Class 1 Survey Fall 2025 2 (2).csv: Original Class 1 survey dataset with 58 observations and 27 variables.  

- Survey Analysis.Rmd: Annotated R Markdown script that imports, cleans, summarizes, and visualizes the dataset.  

- README.md: This file, which describes the project, dataset and analysis code.   


## Dataset Description 

- Source: Collected from students in the Advanced Data Analysis course (Fall 2025)

-Provided by the course instructor and publicly available on GitHub:[Advanced Data Analysis Repository – kijohnson](https://github.com/kijohnson/Advanced-Data-Analysis)  

- Size: 58 observations × 27 variables  

- Content: Information about student demographics, preferences (e.g., cats, dogs, food, drink, hobbies), degree program, R experience, birthdays, and favorite seasons.  

- Purpose: Provides a practice dataset for learning data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization in R.  



## What the Code Does
-Imports the survey dataset from GitHub. 

- Renames variables to shorter and descriptive names.

- Summarizes the dataset (observations, variables, variable types). 

- Cleans and validates birth day and month values; calculates medians. 

- Creates a birth season variable and summarizes season counts.

- Performs a simple analysis (e.g., most common favorite season).

- Generates a bar plot in terms of data visualization .


## How to Run the Code

1. Download or clone this repository. 

2. Open Survey Analysis.Rmd in RStudio.  

3. Ensure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are saved.

4. Run each code chunk in sequence to reproduce the results. 

4. Knit the file for a report Format
